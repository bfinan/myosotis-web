# logo

## Spec

svg logo of a counterclockwise spiral, starting as indigo and shifting to yellow as the spiral circles inward

## notes

(logo should be a clockwise spiral when displayed in the southern hemisphere due to the coriolis effect)
colors should be closer to the colors of the myosotis flower, a punchier version of their blue and yellow

## version 1

made with DALL-E. has kind of a cool optical illusion effect
