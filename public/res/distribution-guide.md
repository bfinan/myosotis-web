Welcome to the Myosotis Distribution Guide! Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to compose a meaningful post, distill it into Markdown, and distribute it on multiple platforms.

## Step 1: Compose With the Medium of Your Choice

Choose the medium that feels the most natural to you, and just write. If the method of composition is a good choice, writing should feel very comfortable and enjoyable for you, regardless of your physical environment.

In 2023, my favorite medium for composition is Medium.com. Visual Studio Code or pen and paper are my favorite alternatives. You, the reader, probably know your favorite mediums intuitively.

Ideally, you should be ready to share with at least one person after you finish Step 1. Editing, translating, and finalizing also happen during Step 1.

## Step 2: Convert Your Writing to Markdown

This is the hardest step, but maybe the most valuable one!

Your words are “marked up” by the medium you composed them with. In this step, you will need to mark them down by converting your post into Markdown or raw text.

You might be familiar with Markdown if you’ve used reddit.com, or Github for code documentation. If you’ve never used Markdown, look for a tutorial on it and come back when you’re ready.

When you’re finished with this step, you’ll have a file on your computer with a *.md extension (e.g. “MyPost.md”). Some tools like Obsidian and Roam Research will export to markdown for you automatically, so they make good composition mediums.

If this step feels tedious, you’re not wrong. It’s important to keep your writing succinct, and to avoid unneeded photos and hyperlinks so that this step goes quickly.

## Step 3: Upload Your Post to Other Platforms

This step is also tedious, but is easily automatable. You could hire someone to do this for you!

Upload your writing to as many platforms as possible! Start by hitting “Publish” on the medium from Step 1. Share your *.md file with any friends or colleagues who also use Markdown.

Post your work on other websites, such as Medium, Substack, and your personal blog. Aiming for a wide audience allows you to get your message to everyone. Additionally, by writing for a large audience, you will immediately improve your writing by thinking about how to make it more accessible.

## A Note on Search Engines and SEO

Making your writing more discoverable through Google is done through a process called Search Engine Optimization (“SEO”). I’ve read some concerns that if you publish on multiple platforms, you might “block yourself” by splitting the “discoverability” of a single post.

My hypothesis is that SEO is overrated. If you truly care about maximum distribution, focus on the content of your article. The bulk of your impact will come from people bookmarking your posts, and sharing them with friends.

I haven’t tested these steps out yet, but I think they form a strong foundation for publishing on multiple mediums.

Happy distributing!
