Why Should You Care About “Programmable Attention”?


2023-05-25

I want to explain my general motivation for my work on “programmable attention”, and my project “[Myosotis](https://myosot.is)”.

“…we come not as conquerors, but as liberators”

We live in an increasingly digital world. New systems and interfaces have been developed that help us to know more and live more empowered lives. I am reminded of a visually impaired woman I saw on a bus in Kansas City, using her Apple Watch’s text-to-speech functionality to navigate to a blood bank.

However, some of these technologies have evolved to capture our attention and extract value from it. The primary example of this attention capture is online advertising, and there are other forms of attention capture that I can write about later.

A goal should be to understand our own attention, so that we can retain more of it for ourselves, and so that we can give it to each other freely. I want to return your attention to you as a matter of personal liberty.
